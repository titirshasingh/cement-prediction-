In this project, we utilized several libraries and methods to analyze and predict concrete compressive strength. The primary libraries include **pandas** for data manipulation, **numpy** for numerical operations, and **seaborn** and **matplotlib** for data visualization. We fetched the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using **ucimlrepo**. Data preprocessing involved exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, including statistical summaries with `describe()` and handling outliers using the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method. Boxplots were created to visualize distributions of key features such as Cement, Blast Furnace Slag, Fly Ash, and Water. These steps help in understanding data patterns and ensuring data quality before model training. If predictive modeling was performed, it would likely involve regression techniques such as **linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks**, depending on the complexity of the dataset and project objectives.
